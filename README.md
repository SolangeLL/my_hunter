## Why do I keep on working on this project ?
In the beginning of my first year at Epitech, I discovered that I really like making video games, especially with the CSFML library. 
But during the duration of the project, I feel restrained and I couldn't explore as deeply as I wanted this library.
So now, I use my free time to discover new functions and possible features.
